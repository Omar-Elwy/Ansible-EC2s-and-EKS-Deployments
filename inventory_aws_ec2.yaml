# We want to get servers public DNS dynamically to ansible So we will neglect the hosts file..

# In the Terraform Config file : we will configure the servers to have a public DNS automatically assigned
# to be able to connect to the servers with ansible from outside the VPC.. for ex: from my LAPTOP

# Enable the plugin and tell it which region we will work at
plugin: aws_ec2
regions: 
  - eu-west-3

# We are grouping the similar instances using their attributes we prefer..
# We can get our graph of instances using this ( ansible-inventory -i inventory_aws_ec2.yaml --graph) in the terminal
# that will give us all the info about the instances depending on the region and filters we specified in that yaml file..
# And then refrence the group name in the (hosts:) part in the ansible playbook 
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags
    prefix: tag
  - key: instance_type
    prefix: instance_type
    
    
filters: 
  tag:Name: dev*  # that will give me onlt the servers with dev tag..
